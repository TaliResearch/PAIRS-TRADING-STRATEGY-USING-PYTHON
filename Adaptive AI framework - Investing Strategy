"""
Creating an adaptive AI for investment management is a complex task that requires a deep understanding of both finance and machine learning. 
However, here is a framework that can function effectively as the core starting point
to create an adaptive AI algorithm trading strategy model for investment management, implemented using Python:

"""
We are using two regression models, LinearRegression and RandomForestRegressor,
to predict investment returns based on historical investment data. We then compare the performance 
of the two models using the coefficient of determination (r2_score), and choose the one with the 
highest score to make predictions for new investment opportunities. Note that this is a very basic
implementation and can be expanded and refined for use in more complex investment management to meet
risk-return constraints and asset classes as required.
